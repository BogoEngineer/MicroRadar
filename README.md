# MicroRadar
This project features the block diagram schematic implementation in Quartus ii for an Altera FPGA of a small machine that has the task of mimicking a radar and detecting the proximity of objects as it rotates around its axis.
The machine is composed of three parts other than the FPGA itself, these are: ultrasonic proximity sensor (hc-sr04), a servo motor with 180 degrees of rotation and a monitor with a VGA cable.
